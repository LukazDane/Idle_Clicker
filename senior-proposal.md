# Seniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal 

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Luke Harrison**


**Project Name: Idle Clicker(wip)** 


Is your project New or Old? **New**


Is your project Solo or Team? **Solo**


## Description

**Base level Idle Clicker written in C# and Unity. An idle clicker is an incremental game where players perform a simple task, in this case clicking, to advance the game and accrue points/currency. This currency can be used to increase the rate of additional currency aquisition.**


**I choose to do this project in C# and Unity to flesh out my portifolio. Many of the companies in the areas of my interest require or value C#/C++ much more than the other languages I am used too using.**

## Objective 1: Create button/action zone.
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** This is essentially the main interactive part of the project. Allows the user to engage with the game. 

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** Complete when user can increment the score/currency by performing some action.  (a click/tap/etc)

## Objective 2: Upgrade button
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** This is, I think, just a logic test, and is the next base function of an idle game. Users need to be able to increase the amount of points/currency gained per click. 

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** Selecting upgrade should change the amount by which scores increase, but only after subtracting the proper amount from total score.

## Objective 3: Tertiary Upgrade / Prestige option
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?**  This is the third function of an idle game. At break points in the game the user should hit a wall. By allowing the User to start from the beggining, but maintain upgrades is an essential feature.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
Game should start back at 0 or "base" level, but "upgrades" or "prestige" purchases should persist. (This is pretty much just making sure the right data is stored and retrieved)
